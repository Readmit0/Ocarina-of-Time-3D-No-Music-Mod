# Ocarina-of-Time-3D-No-Music-Mod
This mod contains the files needed to mute the background music in The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D. It is 100% compatible with the Randomizer, as well as all different versions and regions of Ocarina of Time 3D, and it does not require patching a rom file. 

To install this mod on a 3DS console, put both the QueenSound.bcsar and the QueenStream.bcsar files into /luma/titles/0004000000033500/romfs/sound. If the romfs and sound folders don't exist, please create them. To install this mod on the Citra emulator, put the QueenSound.bcsar and the QueenStream.bcsar files into user\load\mods\0004000000033500\romfs\sound. If the romfs and sound folders don't exist, please create them.
(Please note that the 0004000000033500 folder mentioned in the above example is for the USA 1.0 version of the game, so please be sure to put both .bcsar files into the correct folder for your version of OOT3D.)

Mod Description:

This mod is able to mute ALL of the BGM, including the Grezzo ending credits for both original hardware and emulator, which would cause a softlock for both in the previous version. Jingles such as the ones that play when you get an item, get a heart piece or container, get a mask, beat a race, the playback for ocarina songs, the Zora jam sessions, the Frog Choir, and the Ballad of the Wind Fish Milk Bar song playback have not been removed, in order to maintain the character of the game. The flute that plays Sariaâ€™s Song in the ending credits will appear, Pamela's Music Box House theme will also play, as well as the Song of Healing that plays during the Darunia, Mikau, and Pamela's Father cutscenes.
